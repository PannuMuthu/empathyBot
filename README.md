## Background

This is my work on creating an empathy AI chatbot that can run on various platforms  including Facebook Messenger, Amazon Alexa, SMS, Slack, etc. The goal of this project is to use inverse reinforcement learning techniques in order to develop a chatbot that learns from the empathetic actions of human conversation in order to become an empathy-AI chatbot. The goal is that this project will help bridge the gap between people and machines and increase interconnectivity and friendliness with machine learning and AI techniques. 

This project is sponsored by the UCI UROP and SURP grants.

To boot this bot locally, we recommend the following:

1. `bundle`
2. Start your local Redis server
3. `stealth s`
